## About me
Hello! My name is Eldar and I am 26 years old. I started out programming with IT Step Python Development course and fell in love with developing stuff. My current goal is to become junior front-end developer, and for this I am using various free recourses and community-driven curriculums like The Odin Project and The Rolling Scopes School.
