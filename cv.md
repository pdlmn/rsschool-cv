## About me
Hello! My name is Eldar and I am 26 years old. I started out programming with IT Step Python Development course and fell in love with developing stuff. My current goal is to become junior front-end developer, and for this I am using various free recourses and community-driven curriculums like The Odin Project and The Rolling Scopes School. I am self-disciplined and dedicated enough to learning things on my own, and I love learning new things as well!

Unfortunately currently I am with my family running from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. I am still learning to programm when I have an opportunity.
